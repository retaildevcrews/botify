displayResponse: "To remove stains from your shirt, you can try the following methods based on the type of stain:\n\n1. **Grease Stains**: Rub white chalk over the grease stain, covering it completely. Let it sit for at least 10 minutes to absorb the grease, then brush off the chalk and wash the shirt as usual.
